Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab


Task 1. Create a dataset to store your machine learning models

bq mk ml_dataset


Task 2. Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL ml_dataset.location_model
OPTIONS (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes,
    address as location

FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2017
    AND duration_minutes > 0


Task 3. Create the second machine learning model

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL ml_dataset.subscriber_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2017


Task 4. Evaluate the two machine learning models

SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse, mean_absolute_error
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ml_dataset.location_model, (
  SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes,
	address as location
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
  JOIN
   `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
  ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018)
)

SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse, mean_absolute_error
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ml_dataset.subscriber_model, (
  SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018)
)


Task 5. Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations

SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY trips DESC


SELECT AVG(predicted_duration_minutes) AS average_predicted_trip_length
FROM ML.predict(MODEL ml_dataset.subscriber_model, (
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
  AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'
  AND start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL'))
